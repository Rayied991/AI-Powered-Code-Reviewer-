❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
const sum = () => {
  return a + b;
};
```

🔍 Issues:

- ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, leading to an error or unexpected behavior (likely referencing variables in the outer scope, which is bad practice).
- ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and limited in its utility.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

💡 Improvements:

- ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as arguments, making it reusable with different values.
- ✔️ The `return` statement is explicitly included for clarity (though it could be an implicit return in this case, explicit is often better for readability, especially for beginners).

**Further Considerations (Beyond the immediate fix):**

- **Implicit Return (Optional):** For very simple functions like this, you could use the implicit return syntax for conciseness:

  ```javascript
  const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
  ```

  However, be mindful of readability. If the expression becomes more complex, an explicit `return` is preferred.

- **Error Handling (For Real-World Scenarios):** In a production environment, you might want to add error handling to check if `a` and `b` are actually numbers before performing the addition. This depends on the context of how the `sum` function will be used.

Example with Type Checking:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => {
  if (typeof a !== "number" || typeof b !== "number") {
    return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers."; // Or throw an error
  }
  return a + b;
};
```

Final Note:
The key takeaway is to ensure that the function explicitly defines its input parameters and handles potential errors gracefully, especially when dealing with user-provided data or external APIs. This greatly enhances the reliability and maintainability of the code.
