❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
const sum=()=>{ return a+b}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the scope of the function. This will lead to an error when the function is executed.
*   ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments. It should accept `a` and `b` as input to perform the addition.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as arguments.
*   ✔ The function is self-contained and doesn't rely on variables from the outer scope.

Alternatively, a more concise version:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ This is a more compact way of writing the same function using an implicit return.
*   ✔  Same functionality with cleaner syntax.

Final Note:

Always ensure your functions receive the necessary inputs as arguments and avoid relying on global or undefined variables within the function's scope. Using arrow function syntax is great for concise functions, but make sure the variables are properly passed in! 🚀
